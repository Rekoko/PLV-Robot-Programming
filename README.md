PLV2: Robot Programming
==============================================================

Quick introduction to the problem and how to use the project.

Task
---

The task of the course was to guide a [Turtlebot3-Waffle](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/) through a maze of varying size to reach a goal (a red wall which has to be touched.).

The solution to these tasks was tested on a gazebo simulation while real life use is also possible.

### Maze and Simulation
Mazes have been created for the use of this project.
Follow this [git repository](https://mygit.th-deg.de/gaydos/tb3-maze-challenges) to get them. Clone as follows:

```console
  git clone https://mygit.th-deg.de/gaydos/tb3-maze-challenges
```

### Challenge Files
The python files called solution 1-5 are the scripts required for moving the Robot. After opening the mazes in gazebo, these scripts can be ran to control the robot within the simulation. 

The task for these scripts are being described in the git repository with the mazes.
